Understanding proper etiquette ensures the performer feels valued, your guests feel comfortable, and the entire experience remains positive from start to finish.</p>

                    <p>Whether you're planning a bachelorette party, birthday celebration, or girls night out, these etiquette guidelines help create an environment where entertainment enhances the celebration rather than creating awkward or uncomfortable situations.</p>

                            <p><strong>Base Fee:</strong> Pay the agreed-upon service fee in full, regardless of performance length within the booked time. If the performance ends early due to guest misbehavior, full payment is still owed.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Tipping:</strong> Tips are customary for quality service. Standard is 15-25% of the service fee, with higher amounts for exceptional performances. Have cash ready as many entertainers prefer cash tips.</p>

                            <div class="alert alert-info">
                                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Collect tip money from attendees beforehand rather than passing a collection during or after the performance. This avoids awkward money handling and ensures appropriate compensation.
